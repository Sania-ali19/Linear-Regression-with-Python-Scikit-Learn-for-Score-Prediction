This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict scores based on input features using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The model establishes a linear relationship between the input variables and the target scores, and is evaluated using common regression metrics.

Key Features:
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess score data for model input.
Model Training: Implement Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.
Evaluation: Calculate performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
Visualization: Plot the regression line and the actual data points for visual analysis.
Steps:
Import libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.
Prepare and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Linear Regression model and make predictions.
Evaluate the model's accuracy using MSE and R².
Visualize the results with scatter plots and regression lines.
